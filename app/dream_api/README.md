#### Description
- One of the large hurdles for advancing combination therapy is the selection of patients who are likely to benefit from specific combinations. 
- the selection of sub- populations using genetic or genomic biomarkers will be critical for the successful administration of combination agents. 
- This Challenge is designed to explore fundamental traits that underlie effective combination treatments and synergistic drug behavior using baseline genomic data,
- 11.5k experimentally tested drug combinations measuring cell viability over 118 drugs and 85 cancer cell lines (primarily colon, lung, and breast), and monotherapy drug response data for each drug and cell line
- genomic data including gene expression, mutations (whole exome), copy-number alterations, and methylation data
